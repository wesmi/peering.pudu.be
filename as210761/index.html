<title>Peering for AS210761 - Pudu LLC</title>
</head>

<h1 align="center">AS210761</h1>

<p>Peering is not usually done on this AS.  It is a downstream network with a different routing policy than the main peering
network on AS47689.  Peers to 210761 would likely be for hobby or experimenting with wildly different things we want to
keep off of our production networks.</p>

<p>You can find our network information <a href="https://peeringdb.com/net/29351">on PeeringDB</a> but in general you should expect fairly low traffic and a maximum of 5 IPv4 prefixes and 10 IPv6 prefixes.  All prefixes will have IRR and RPKI records.</p>
