<h1 align="center">AS47689</h1>

<p>Peering is largely available for this AS.  Routes are available via the route servers at SampleIXP, Imaginary-XP, and 
ProbablyUnrealExchange.</p>

<p>You can find our network information <a href="https://peeringdb.com/net/29352">on PeeringDB</a> but in general you should 
expect fairly low traffic and a maximum of 5 IPv4 prefixes and 10 IPv6 prefixes.  All prefixes will have IRR and RPKI 
records.</p>

<h1 align="center">AS210761</h1>

<p>Peering is not usually done on this AS.  It is a downstream network with a different routing policy than the main peering
network on AS47689.  Peers to 210761 would likely be for hobby or experimenting with wildly different things we want to
keep off of our production networks.</p>
